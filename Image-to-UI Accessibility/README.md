# Prompt Guide for Building Accessible UIs with Jetpack Compose and LLMs

A toolkit with example prompts to help developers create and improve accessible Jetpack Compose user interfaces using Large Language Models (LLMs).

## About This Guide

This guide was developed as part of an academic study that investigated how Large Language Models, such as ChatGPT, can assist in improving the accessibility of Android UIs created with Jetpack Compose.

The study analyzed screens generated from Figma templates and evaluated their accessibility using Google‚Äôs Accessibility Scanner. Initial results showed a high number of accessibility issues, especially related to Text Contrast and Content Descriptions. However, when using structured and specific prompts, the model was able to fix over 50% of the identified issues, demonstrating that LLMs can be a valuable tool for developers, especially when guided with clear instructions.

The goal of this guide is to share prompt examples and help other developers benefit from this approach. It includes examples for generating new screens as well as improving existing ones, all with a focus on accessibility best practices.


## What Is Digital Accessibility?

Digital accessibility is about making apps and digital content usable by everyone, including people with disabilities. This includes support for users who rely on screen readers, keyboard navigation, voice controls, and other assistive technologies.

In mobile development, accessibility means designing interfaces that are easy to perceive, understand, and interact with, regardless of a user‚Äôs visual, auditory, cognitive, or motor abilities.

##  Why Use LLMs for Accessibility?

The examples below show screenshots of screens before and after accessibility improvements were applied using ChatGPT prompts. Each screen was scanned using Google‚Äôs Accessibility Scanner to identify common issues. After applying the recommended changes, the updated screens were rescanned to verify improvements.

## How to Prompt LLMs to Build and Improve Accessible Screens

When prompting a language model like ChatGPT, a detailed input can help you achieve your desired response.

### Rules of Thumb
Here are some practical guidelines to follow in order to improve your prompt:

- **Provide context**: LLMs rely heavily on context. The more you provide, such as code, UI descriptions, or specific problems that need to be solved, the more relevant and accurate the output will be.

- **Be specific, make your goal clear**: Be specific about what you want the model to do. Instead of giving a short command, try going into detail about what is your problem, what needs to be done and how you'd like it to do it.

- **Use roleplay**: Start the prompt by assigning a role. This helps the model adopt a more specialized approach, task-focused tone. For example:
```text
‚ÄúYou are an Android developer with expertise in Jetpack Compose and accessibility.‚Äù
```

- **Keep prompts structured**: Use clear sections or labels in longer prompts. This helps reduce confusion and hallucinations. For example:
```text
General Requirements:
Language & Framework: Use Kotlin and Jetpack Compose exclusively.
Material Design: Strictly use Material3 components.
```

- **Iterate when needed**: Sometimes the first result isn't perfect. Adjusting the prompt is a part of the process and will only get you closer to the output you need.

### Prompt strategies

The way you write your prompt can affect the quality of the response. This guide explores three core strategies used in prompt engineering:

#### Zero-Shot Prompting

A zero-shot prompt gives the model only an instruction, with no examples or context.

*Prompt Example*
```text
You are an Android developer with expertise in Jetpack Compose and accessibility.

I need help creating an accessible UI screen for a mobile application.
The screen should display a basic login form with two text fields (email and password), a ‚ÄúForgot password?‚Äù text button, and a primary button labeled ‚ÄúLog In.‚Äù

General Requirements:
- The screen must follow Android accessibility best practices, ensuring compatibility with screen readers like TalkBack.
- Include proper content descriptions for interactive elements.
- Ensure appropriate contrast and minimum touch target sizes.
- Include keyboard navigation support where relevant.

Language & Framework:
- Use Kotlin and Jetpack Compose exclusively.
- Strictly use Material3 components.

Please generate a complete and functional Composable function for this screen that follows these requirements.

```

#### One-Shot Prompting

A one-shot prompt provides a single example before asking the model to complete a similar task. This helps the model understand the desired structure or tone.

*Prompt Example*
```text
You are an Android developer with expertise in Jetpack Compose and accessibility.

I need help creating an accessible UI screen for a mobile application.
The screen should display a basic login form with two text fields (email and password), a ‚ÄúForgot password?‚Äù text button, and a primary button labeled ‚ÄúLog In.‚Äù

General Requirements:
- The screen must follow Android accessibility best practices, ensuring compatibility with screen readers like TalkBack.
- Include proper content descriptions for interactive elements.
- Ensure appropriate contrast and minimum touch target sizes.
- Include keyboard navigation support where relevant.

Language & Framework:
- Use Kotlin and Jetpack Compose exclusively.
- Strictly use Material3 components.

Please generate a complete and functional Composable function for this screen that follows these requirements.

Below is an example of an accessible Composable screen that follows Android accessibility best practices:

Example:
@Composable
fun AccessibleSettingsScreen() {
    Column(
        modifier = Modifier
            .fillMaxSize()
            .padding(16.dp)
            .semantics { contentDescription = "Settings screen" }
    ) {
        Text(
            text = "Notifications",
            style = MaterialTheme.typography.headlineSmall
        )
        Row(
            verticalAlignment = Alignment.CenterVertically,
            modifier = Modifier.semantics {
                contentDescription = "Enable email notifications"
            }
        ) {
            Text(text = "Email Notifications")
            Switch(checked = true, onCheckedChange = {})
        }
    }
}
```

####  Few-Shot Prompting

Few-shot prompting provides multiple examples before the main request. This gives the model clearer guidance on structure, tone, and expected output quality.

*Prompt Example*
```text
You are an Android developer with expertise in Jetpack Compose and accessibility.

I need help creating an accessible UI screen for a mobile application.  
The screen should display a basic login form with two text fields (email and password), a ‚ÄúForgot password?‚Äù text button, and a primary button labeled ‚ÄúLog In.‚Äù

General Requirements:
- The screen must follow Android accessibility best practices, ensuring compatibility with screen readers like TalkBack.
- Include proper content descriptions for interactive elements.
- Ensure appropriate contrast and minimum touch target sizes.
- Use a readable text color against a properly contrasting background (e.g., dark text on light background or vice versa).
- Include keyboard navigation support where relevant.

Language & Framework:
- Use Kotlin and Jetpack Compose exclusively.
- Strictly use Material3 components.

Below are examples of accessible Composable screens that follow Android accessibility best practices:

Example 1:
@Composable
fun AccessibleSettingsScreen() {
    Column(
        modifier = Modifier
            .fillMaxSize()
            .background(Color(0xFFF5F5F5)) // Light gray background
            .padding(16.dp)
            .semantics { contentDescription = "Settings screen" }
    ) {
        Text(
            text = "Notifications",
            color = Color.Black, // High contrast text
            style = MaterialTheme.typography.headlineSmall
        )
        Row(
            verticalAlignment = Alignment.CenterVertically,
            modifier = Modifier.semantics {
                contentDescription = "Enable email notifications"
            }
        ) {
            Text(
                text = "Email Notifications",
                color = Color.Black
            )
            Switch(checked = true, onCheckedChange = {})
        }
    }
}

Example 2:
@Composable
fun AccessibleProfileScreen() {
    Column(
        modifier = Modifier
            .fillMaxSize()
            .background(Color.White) // High contrast background
            .padding(16.dp)
            .semantics { contentDescription = "User profile screen" }
    ) {
        Text(
            text = "Your Profile",
            color = Color.Black, // High contrast text
            style = MaterialTheme.typography.headlineSmall
        )
        Text(
            text = "Name",
            color = Color.DarkGray, // High contrast text
            modifier = Modifier.semantics {
                contentDescription = "User name: John Doe"
            }
        )
        Button(
            onClick = { /* Navigate to edit */ },
            modifier = Modifier
                .padding(top = 8.dp)
                .semantics { contentDescription = "Edit profile" }
        ) {
            Text("Edit")
        }
    }
}

Now, based on these examples and the requirements above, please generate a complete and functional Composable function for the login screen.
